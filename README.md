### What is Pokemon Showdown?
Pokémon Showdown is a popular online battle simulator for Pokémon fans. It allows players to create and customize teams of Pokémon, choosing moves, abilities, and items for each Pokémon. The platform replicates competitive Pokémon battles found in the main series games, providing a space for players to test strategies, compete in various tiers and formats, and engage in battles with other trainers worldwide in real-time.

Both casual players and competitive battlers widely use the simulator to practice, refine strategies, and participate in tournaments without the need for physical game copies or handheld consoles. It offers a range of battle formats, from standard 6v6 singles to doubles, random battles, and custom rule sets, catering to different playstyles and preferences within the Pokémon community.
